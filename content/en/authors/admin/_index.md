I am doing research on atmospheric aerosols and their climate and environmental impact. I have been involved in air quality and climate change projects in Venezuela, Brazil and Germany. Specifically, I have experience in using optical instrumentation for aerosol measurements.

This website comprises a compilation of my academic publications and some resources for science communication that I will be sharing in the blog section (mostly in Spanish). Moreover, I will be posting notes about data analysis and visualization, especially of environmental data.
